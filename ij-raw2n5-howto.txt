1) Open raw volume in ImageJ (make sure N5 Viewer plugin is installed and updated)
2) Save as -> N5
    Options: 
        N5 root url: path/to/folder/dataset.n5
        Dataset: /volumes/name
        Block size: 64,64,64
        Compression: blosc
        metadata type: Custom -> (after entering options and continuing, put the following in the metadata box)
            {
                "blockSize": .blockSize,
                "compression": .compression,
                "dataType": .dataType,
                "dimensions": .dimensions,
                "offset": [
                    .zOrigin,
                    .yOrigin,
                    .xOrigin
                ],
                "resolution": [
                    .zResolution,
                    .yResolution,
                    .xResolution
                ]
            }
        Thread count: pick a reasonable number
        Overwrite options: You decide (probably "No overwrite")
        Overwrite subset offset: (probably leave blank)

3) Double check the path/to/folder/dataset.n5/volumes/name/attributes.json to verify info is correct afterwards
